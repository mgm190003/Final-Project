## Description: 
A rogue-lite survival game where the player faces endless waves of enemies that increasingly grow in strength. The player will gain powers over time based on their performance. The goal of the game is to last as long as possible
## Features:
1. Controllable character that can attack in some way.
2. Multiple enemy types that increase in number over time
3. Multiple types of powerups that the player can gain to increase their strength
4. Main menu that shows high score
5. Timer that tracks how long the player has been alive
## Challenges
1. When the player is selecting a powerup, I will need to pause the game in someway. I'm not yet sure the best way to do this so I'll have to find that out
2. I will need to figure out how to track time accurately in the game
3. I will need to create a main menu that lets the player start the game
4. I will need a way for the game to detect keybind inputs from the user
5. I will need accurate hit detection and hitboxes for my player and enemies
## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome - I would really like to make a fun rogue-lite with really interesting powerups that make the game fun and unique. I would like to add a main menu that shows high score and lets the player start the game. I want the game to be somewhat challenging and not just a complete pushover. I really want there to be at least 9 or 10 different powerups, more if possible and 3 or more enemy types. I think it would also be really cool for a big boss enemy to spawn after a while or so. 
Minimal Viable Outcome - The minimum I would need for this project is a game with a controllable character, enemies that spawn increasingly fast, and a form of an upgrade system for the player
## Milestones
1. By the first week, I hope to have a controllable player character
2. By the second week, I think I should have enemies that will move towards the player and attack them
3. By the third week I should have some upgrades available for the player and refined the enemy attacks more
4. By the fourth week I should have a timer and main menu implemented
